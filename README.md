# Multiplication-Boards-and-Number-Formatting
1st assignment from year 1, 2nd semester of Computer Science

(C)

This assignment has 2 parts to it:

**Question 1:

A. Write a program that prints out a 10x10 multiplication table.
B. Write a program that recieves as input a number 'MaxMult', & prints out the corresponding MaxMulti x MaxMulti multiplication table.

EX:

for MaxMult = 4, the program would print out:

 1 2  3  4
 2 4  6  8
 3 6  9 12
 4 8 12 16


*Notes:
- All printouts must be in table form, & each instance must be alligned correctly to the right (each digit above and under the correct ones
from all lines).
- Refrain from adding too many spaces (number on the bottom right should have 1 space before it).
